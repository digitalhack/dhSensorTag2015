Two examples which show how to access sensor data from the sensor tag running TI's firmware.  Examples were developed using v1.12 (Jun 23 2015) firmware.

Examples include getting the device name and getting data from the humidity sensor.

##Python Examples##

Six examples which show how to access sensor data from the sensor tag running TI's firmware.  Examples were developed using V1.12 (Jun 23 2015) firmware.

Examples are included that read the barometer, humidity, IR temperature, luxometer, movement sensors and the buttons or keys.

Values for the humidity, IR temperature, and luxometer have been validated against TI's Android App.  The barometer reading in TI's Android App is incorrect.  Data from the movement sensor hasn't been validated.

The python modules use Ian Harvey's bluepy module from https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy.
